# clox
An interpreter of the Lox scripting language, implemented in C.

Lox is a scripting language described in Bob Nystrom's book "[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html)". This repo is to build the interpreter alongside with the book, and to play around with adding extra features.
